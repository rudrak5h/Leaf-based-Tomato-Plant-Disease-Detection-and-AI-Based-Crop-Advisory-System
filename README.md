This project is a deep learning–based system for detecting tomato plant diseases from leaf images and providing AI-based crop advisory.

## 🚀 Features
- CNN-based image classification using ResNet50
- Transfer learning with PyTorch
- Disease prediction with confidence score
- AI-based advisory including:
  - Disease description
  - Causes
  - Prevention
  - Treatment
- Interactive Gradio web interface

## 🧠 Model Details
- Architecture: ResNet50
- Framework: PyTorch
- Classes: 10 tomato leaf conditions
- Evaluation Metric: Macro F1-score ≈ 0.90

## 🖥️ How to Use
1. Upload a tomato leaf image
2. The system predicts the disease
3. AI advisory is generated instantly

## 📦 Deployment
This app is deployed using **Hugging Face Spaces** with Gradio.
