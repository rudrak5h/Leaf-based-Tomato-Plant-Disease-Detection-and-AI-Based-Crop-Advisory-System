ADVISORY_DATA = {
    "Tomato__Target_Spot": {
        "description": "Caused by the fungus Corynespora cassiicola, appearing as small, circular to irregular lesions with concentric rings.",
        "causes": "High humidity, frequent rainfall, and warm temperatures (25-30°C).",
        "prevention": "Improve air circulation, use drip irrigation to keep leaves dry, and rotate crops.",
        "treatment": "Apply fungicides containing chlorothalonil or mancozeb."
    },
    "Tomato__Tomato_mosaic_virus": {
        "description": "A viral infection that causes mottling and discoloration of leaves, often leading to stunted growth.",
        "causes": "Mechanical transmission through contaminated tools, hands, or infected seeds.",
        "prevention": "Use certified virus-free seeds, sanitize tools with 10% bleach, and remove infected plants immediately.",
        "treatment": "No chemical cure; focus on removing infected debris and managing insect vectors."
    },
    "Tomato__Tomato_YellowLeaf__Curl_Virus": {
        "description": "One of the most destructive viral diseases, causing severe curling and yellowing of young leaves.",
        "causes": "Transmitted exclusively by the silverleaf whitefly (Bemisia tabaci).",
        "prevention": "Use fine-mesh netting to exclude whiteflies and eliminate nearby weeds that host the virus.",
        "treatment": "Control whitefly populations using neem oil or insecticidal soaps."
    },
    "Tomato_Bacterial_spot": {
        "description": "A bacterial disease causing small, water-soaked spots that eventually turn dark brown.",
        "causes": "Bacterium Xanthomonas, spread by splashing rain or overhead irrigation in warm weather.",
        "prevention": "Avoid overhead watering and do not work in the garden when plants are wet.",
        "treatment": "Use copper-based bactericides early in the infection stage."
    },
    "Tomato_Early_blight": {
        "description": "Fungal disease characterized by 'bullseye' concentric rings on older leaves near the soil[cite: 18, 58].",
        "causes": "Alternaria solani fungus thriving in high humidity and warm temperatures[cite: 59].",
        "prevention": "Mulching to prevent soil splash and pruning lower leaves for better airflow[cite: 60].",
        "treatment": "Apply copper fungicides or fungicides containing chlorothalonil[cite: 61]."
    },
    "Tomato_healthy": {
        "description": "The leaf shows no signs of disease and appears to have optimal chlorophyll levels[cite: 17].",
        "causes": "Good soil health, proper watering, and effective pest management.",
        "prevention": "Maintain regular scouting and consistent nutrient application.",
        "treatment": "None required; continue standard care."
    },
    "Tomato_Late_blight": {
        "description": "A fast-moving disease that causes dark, water-soaked patches on leaves and stems[cite: 19, 58].",
        "causes": "Phytophthora infestans fungus, which thrives in cool, wet, and foggy conditions[cite: 59].",
        "prevention": "Avoid planting near potatoes and ensure high-clearance spacing between rows[cite: 60].",
        "treatment": "Apply systemic fungicides and remove heavily infected plants immediately to prevent spread[cite: 61]."
    },
    "Tomato_Leaf_Mold": {
        "description": "A fungal infection causing pale-green or yellowish spots on the upper leaf surface and olive-green mold underneath.",
        "causes": "High relative humidity (above 85%) and poor ventilation in greenhouses.",
        "prevention": "Lower humidity by increasing spacing and using fans for air movement.",
        "treatment": "Apply fungicides like calcium polysulfide or copper-based sprays."
    },
    "Tomato_Septoria_leaf_spot": {
        "description": "Fungal disease causing numerous small, circular spots with dark borders and grey centers.",
        "causes": "Septoria lycopersici fungus spread by rain or wind-blown spores.",
        "prevention": "Remove crop residue at the end of the season and practice a 3-year crop rotation.",
        "treatment": "Apply fungicides early in the season to prevent the upward spread of the disease."
    },
    "Tomato_Spider_mites_Two_spotted_spider_mite": {
        "description": "Tiny pests that suck the contents out of plant cells, causing yellow stippling and webbing.",
        "causes": "Hot, dry, and dusty conditions where mites reproduce rapidly.",
        "prevention": "Keep plants well-hydrated and periodically wash leaves with a strong stream of water.",
        "treatment": "Use miticides, horticultural oil, or introduce predatory mites as biological control."
